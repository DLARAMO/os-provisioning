This whole directory can be removed when all SmartOnt installations have been migrated to PostgreSQL


What do do?

* Dump the whole nmsprime* databases (Maria and Postgres)!
* Get a clean, empty Postgres dump from the devel VM (from the same commit as on the SmartOnt machine)
* Run the migrations in Maria â€“ now the schemas should be compatible
* execute the shell script to convert/move data
